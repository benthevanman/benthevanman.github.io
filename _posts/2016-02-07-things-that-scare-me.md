title: Things that scare me about living in a van
---


There are a number of things that concern me about living in my van. 

1. Mechanical breakdown 
2. Theft
3. Being woken up by police
4. “Living on the streets”
5. Not having a consistent place to sleep
6. Tight quarters with my partner
7. Scheduling shower/gym/water fill ups/propane/diesel/food/cooking/sleeping/driving/pooping/etc
8. Physical security

Things that would scare me about living a "normal" life:

1. Paying my mortgage
2. Having a mortgage in the first place
3. More debt, lots of debt
4. Working a job that I hate because I have no other choice
5. Paying bills and mortgage on a house that’s empty most of the time
6. Theft
7. Never having enough adventures and vacation
8. Not truly living my life
9. Not having any flexibility
10. Physical security
11. Taking longer to pay off student loans

So which is worse? Both lifestyles have their own luxuries and hardships. I am going to try #vanlife because the idea of living a “normal” life doesn’t appeal to me. I’ll take the good with the bad and enjoy the additional freedom that this lifestyle allows.
