Hi! I'm Ben Reichert and I just bought a 2004 Freightliner Sprinter. 

I am going to be converting the Sprinter into a home to live in full time. 

I have been dreaming of alternative lifestyles for some time now. I originally wanted to build a tiny house on a piece of land. This was prohibitively expensive at this point in my life, so I looked into alternative means of living. Also, If I were building a tiny house or yurt or earthen home on site, I would need a place to live. I thought “I can buy a trailer and truck and live in that!”. Or, “I could buy a small RV or van and live in there while building the home!”. This made sense, but I would still need for fork over the cash for land, a temporary home, and then the home building costs. I decided to eliminate the costs and just live in a van instead :)

When I decide to settle down, I would like to return to the land idea, but that won’t be for a while now. 

I'll try to keep useful information about my conversion posted here, and Sprinter information.
